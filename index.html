            <p>Hey there! We've heard some of you got tricked by fake sites pretending to be us. That's really upsetting, like when you're excited for your favorite snack but find out it's sold out.

                Don’t worry, though! Make sure you keep this page bookmarked. It's your guide to finding us, the real HiAnime.</p>
